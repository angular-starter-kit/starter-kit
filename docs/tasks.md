# Gulp

The build system of this project is based on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), to automate the development and build workflow.

The various tasks described here are defined in modules located in the `gulp/` folder. You can read more about how to
customize them and define your own tasks in the
[Gulp documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

## Default task
```
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment.
This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Main tasks

build      | Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.
clean      | Delete temporary files and dist files.

When building the application, you can specify the target environment using the flag `--environment <name>`.

The default build environment is `production`. See [this documentation](docs/build-environments.md) for more details
about multiple build environments management.

You can disable opening automatically your default browser when using the `serve` commands by using the flag
`--skip-open`.

When building your app, you can use the `--debug` flag with any build task to skip the minification process. This can
be useful to debug your production builds.

## Cordova

cordova --command="&lt;command>" | Executes any cordova command (see [cordova-cli](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli)).

Note that all the cordova tasks support a `--fast` option that allows to skip the rebuild of the source folder and
the resources compression. Use it only when your know that the sources have not changed.
